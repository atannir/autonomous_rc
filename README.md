# Banana Drone - The Bug-free Buggy
This repository is for my autonomous RC car project using a Raspberry Pi and an off-the-shelf RC car. Training and navigation are handled by Keras and TensorFlow.

This project was started shortly after November 24th, when the RC car was purchased.

More documentation can be found in each directory.
