The base hardware for this project is a New Bright Baja Vortex RC car resembling a dune buggy. Other components include a Raspberry Pi, a standard 5.8 GHz drone camera, a small lithium battery mounted on the car, a set of three 18650 batteries, a video receiver, an easycap analog video digitizer, a wrist-sized video monitor, and various cables and connections. The batteries for the video receiver and Raspberry Pi are connected with a Y connector, providing approximately 11 volts to the receiver and a standard automobile auxilary power connector and off-the-shelf USB adapter to supply the Raspberry Pi with 5 volts. Under testing, these batteries were able to provide power for 8 hours when the Pi was under no processor load. Estimates show that this power source should be able to provide 3 hours of usage, likely long after other batteries in the system have run out.
